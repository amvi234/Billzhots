This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# MFA

This implementation covers the full authentication flow with MFA:

User enters username and password
If credentials are valid, the backend returns an OTP challenge
User enters the OTP code
If OTP is valid, the backend returns access and refresh tokens
The tokens are stored in local storage
Subsequent API requests include the access token in the Authorization header
If the access token expires, the refresh token is used to get a new access token

To use this implementation:

Add the auth service file to your project
Update your SignInPage component
Add the auth types file
Modify your backend to add the verify-otp endpoint
Make sure your localStorageManager has the necessary token handling functions
Update your axios instance to include the authorization header

You'll also need to make sure your routes are properly protected using the authentication state.
